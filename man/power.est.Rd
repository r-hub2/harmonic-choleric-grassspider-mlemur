\item{rate1}{Mutation rate of the first strain.}

\item{rate2}{Mutation rate of the second strain.}

\item{Nt1}{Average culture size of the first strain.}

\item{Nt2}{Average culture size of the second strain.}

\item{e2}{Plating efficiency of the second strain.}

\item{w1}{Relative mutant fitness of the first strain.}

\item{w2}{Relative mutant fitness of the second strain.}

\item{lag1}{Phenotypic lag of the first strain.}

\item{lag2}{Phenotypic lag of the second strain.}

\item{death1}{Relative death rate of the first strain.}

\item{death2}{Relative death rate of the second strain.}

\item{phi1}{Size of inoculum in proportion to the total culture size of the first strain.}

\item{phi2}{Size of inoculum in proportion to the total culture size of the second strain.}

\item{cv1}{Coefficient of variation of the culture sizes of the first strain.}

\item{cv2}{Coefficient of variation of the culture sizes of the second strain.}

\item{poisson1}{Average number of residual Poisson-distributed mutations on the plate of the first strain.}

\value{
A vector of length 1 or a matrix of size length(n1) x length(n2) containing values of the power.
}
\description{
This function calculates theoretical power of the likelihood ratio test given prescribed mutation rates,
final culture sizes, and sample sizes.
